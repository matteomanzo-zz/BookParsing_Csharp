C# is a compiled programming language. The computer cannot understand the language directly, so a program called a compiler converts the C# text into the low level instructions which are much simpler. These low level instructions are in turn converted into the actual commands to drive the hardware which runs your program. We will look in more detail at this aspect of how C# programs work a little later, for now the thing to remember is that you need to show your wonderful C# program to the compiler before you get to actually run it. A compiler is a very large program which knows how to decide if your program is legal. The first thing it does is check for errors in the way that you have used the language itself. Only if no errors are found by the compiler will it produce any output. The compiler will also flag up warnings which occur when it notices that you have done something which is not technically illegal, but may indicate that you have made a mistake somewhere. An example of a warning situation is where you create something but don't use it for anything. The compiler would tell you about this, in case you had forgotten to add a bit of your program. The C# language is supplied with a whole bunch of other stuff (to use a technical term) which lets C# programs do things like read text from the keyboard, print on the screen, set up network connections and the like. These extra features are available to your C# program but you must explicitly ask for them. They are then located automatically when your program runs. Later on we will look at how you can break a program of your own down into a number of different chunks (perhaps so several different programmers can work on it).
